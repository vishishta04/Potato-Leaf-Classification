# Potato-Leaf-Classification
 Potato Leaf Classification using CNN is a machine learning model that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks to distinguish between early blight and late blight in potato leaves. By analyzing leaf images, the model accurately identifies the type of blight, aiding in timely disease management and crop protection.
